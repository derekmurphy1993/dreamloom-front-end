### Storing and Retrieving Data
  The core element to this app is the functionality and communication with the back-end api database. [www.linktobackendgit.com]
When a user logs in the have the ability to log a new dream, browse their collection of dreams, view the full details of a dream, edit that dream or delete it.

### The Process
The concept of this app has existed for a long time, with a large scope of functions and views. Keeping SOLID design principals in mind, I decided on building the app in several stages. I created user stories and wireframes for a version 1 that would strictly be the foundational database that could store users and dreams.

I created the back end using _Ruby on Rails_ containing a dreams table with a one to many relationship to a users table.
